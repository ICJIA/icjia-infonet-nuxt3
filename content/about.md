## Regional DVFR Teams 

Regional Domestic Violence Fatality Review Teams are responsible for conducting a designated number of comprehensive individual case reviews quarterly. These cases will consist of fatalities and near-fatalities that are believed to be the result of domestic violence, including overdoses and suicides. As part of these in-depth case reviews, teams will collect and review a variety of records, conduct interviews, look at victim/survivor/abuser contact with various systems, and identify both vulnerabilities and strengths in the intervention process.

Teams will use their findings to identify opportunities for improvement in domestic violence intervention strategies and systems collaboration and make annual recommendations to the Statewide Committee. 

Teams must be organized by circuit court boundaries but may be formed as county, jurisdiction, beat, or neighborhood specific. 

The Statewide DVFR Committee is actively recruiting stakeholder groups in Illinois that are interested in forming a domestic violence fatality review team in their area. For more information, please email us at [fatalityreview@ilcadv.org](mailto:fatalityreview@ilcadv.org).
