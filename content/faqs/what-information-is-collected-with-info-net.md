question: What information is collected with InfoNet?
answer: >-
  Basic information about all victims (clients) who receive services from a
  community based service provider is entered into InfoNet, including
  demographics, health insurance, employment, education, marital status, income
  source, referral source, and special needs. The type of victimization and
  severity of abuse is also captured, as well as victim interactions with legal
  and health care systems. Data are also entered about the abuser’s involvement
  with the criminal justice system, including arrests, charges filed, case
  dispositions, and sentences. Information is added to a client’s record over
  time, creating a history of services and events. Information that could be
  used to identify a client, such as name or birth date, is not entered into
  InfoNet. Rather, a unique number is used to track each client.


  Additionally, service providers enter all services provided by staff and volunteers. This includes services to clients such as crisis intervention and court advocacy, as well as services to the community such as prevention, training and public awareness. Administrative information entered into InfoNet includes staff funding sources and allowable services, which is used to generate reports that reflect grant specific information.
